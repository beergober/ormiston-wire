It is often applied by wrapping it around the heads of bolts or nuts and then twisting or crimping the ends together. This process effectively prevents fasteners from unscrewing or unintentionally coming loose.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How is safety wiring applied?<\/h2>\n<p>Safety wire is usually wrapped around the heads of bolts or nuts and then twisted or crimped to ensure that they are properly tightened together.<\/p>\n<p>The safety wire needs to be threaded through a hole in the fastener of the object so that it creates tension opposite to the direction that the fastener would be loosened.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, the wire is passed through a hole drilled into a second fastener or component, then twisted and secured to another fastener or component, before being twisted once more to ensure that the fasteners have been properly tightened.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What are the main applications for lock wire?<\/h2>\n<p>Locking wire has a wide range of uses, including such as aviation, manufacturing, and racing applications where securing fasteners is critical for safety and reliability.<\/p>\n<p>Locking wire is an essential safety measure in many applications where failure of fasteners could lead to catastrophic consequences. It provides an additional layer of security beyond traditional methods of fastening, helping to ensure the integrity and reliability of mechanical systems.<\/p>\n<p>From high performance cars to aeroplanes, locking wire is a vital tool to ensure safety and security.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Is locking wire reusable?<\/h2>\n<p>Locking wire is a one-time use item. Once applied and secured, it is typically cut and removed during maintenance or repair procedures.<\/p>\n<p>If safety wire needs to be removed or a fastener needs to be opened, then it will need to be replaced with new wire.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Are there different types of locking wire?<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, there are various types of locking wire available and we stock six varieties at Ormiston Wire. This includes Black Mild Steel Locking Wire, Galvanised Mild Steel Locking Wire, Plain Copper Locking Wire, Stainless Steel Locking Wire, Stainless Steel Locking Wire, and Tinned Copper Locking Wire.<\/p>\n<p>The products in this range all have specific characteristics for different applications. The safety wire that you choose for your project will depend on various factors such as the size of your fasteners, the level of vibration, and environmental conditions.<\/p><\/div><script type=\"application\/ld+json\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What is locking wire?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"Locking wire, also known as safety wire, is a positive locking device that is used to secure fasteners such as nuts, bolts, screws, and other components in projects where vibrations, stress, or other forces could cause them to come loose.\\nLocking wire is typically made of stainless steel to ensure its durability and longevity.
