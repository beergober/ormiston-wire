Whether you're looking for galvanised wire or cables for gym equipment, we have you covered. If specialist cables and wires are the answer, we can usually supply it.<\/p>\n\n<p>We are not only a source of wire but also a source of extensive knowledge that comes from years of expertise in the wire and cable industry.<\/p>\n\n<p>We have worked with the special effects departments of many film and TV production companies. So if you have ever wondered what really makes 'Thunderbirds Go', it's often Ormiston wire!<\/p>\n\n<p>Our wire ropes are used to tether goats and other animals, so the space they have to roam is not too free range. We even supply wire to prevent moss growing on roofs.<\/p>\n\n<p>For us, no specification is too large, too small, or too unlikely.<\/p>\n\n<p>From your initial consultation to quality assurance on your finished product, we pride ourselves in attention to detail at every stage of the supply chain process.

We have manufactured wire turbulators since 1968 and have developed our own specialist looped-spiral design.<\/p>\n<p>The turbulators we offer are manufactured from wire in the form of a looped spiral as illustrated, and we consider they have many advantages over Fin or Spiral sheet metal types.<\/p>\n<p>The density of the turbulator can be varied to suit the liquid or gas flowing through the tube to give maximum excitement and heat transfer coefficient with a minimum loss of pressure thus economising on the length, diameter or number of tubes required per unit and allowing flow pumps to be kept to a minimum size.<\/p>\n<p>Our turbulators are normally manufactured with a small eye at one end (to facilitate easy pull through the tubes) and a tail can be left at the other end for joining on any follow up length, when tubes over 3.00 metres long are involved.<\/p>\n<p>These turbulators normally need no fixing in the tubes as wires grip quite tightly and do not tend to move with a normal flow of liquid or gas.<\/p>\n<p>The wire from which this product is made can be of almost any metal and our present production includes galvanised mild steel, Stainless Steel, Copper and Monel Metal.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"x-col e2-e103 m2-1h m2-1j\"><div class=\"x-bg\"><div class=\"x-bg-layer-lower-img\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ormiston-wire.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cs-pagepic-heat2.jpg\" alt=\"Wire provided by Ormiston UK Wire Manufacturers\" style=\"object-fit: cover;
