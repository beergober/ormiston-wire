What matters most is the integrity of your build and how<br \/>\neffectively your wiring is implemented. But what if you\u2019re building a new hotel and want it to look clean and pristine?<br \/>\nOr you\u2019re sculpting an eye-catching art piece and don\u2019t want wires taking pride of place on your work?<\/p>\n<p>We know that strength and integrity shouldn\u2019t compromise the appearance of wiring, a material that (unless otherwise stated by a client) should be as subtle as possible, disappearing in a structure like a chameleon on a rock.<span id=\"more-350\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Whether in an aesthetic context or not, your wiring should match its surroundings while still providing you with the optimal usability you\u2019d expect.<\/p>\n<p>To prove the point, we\u2019ve come up with a few examples of some ideal places where our wire has been used, and the amazing ways that they\u2019ve melded with the products they support.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Art and sculpture <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Being a top-grade artist isn\u2019t solely about creating whatever\u2019s in your head and crossing your fingers that people enjoy it. If you\u2019re planning to make a large-scale sculpture, you\u2019ll need the brains of an architect as well as the creative spirit of a true artist.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve developed a strong relationship with many of the leading artists across the country, and they all turn to us to provide wiring that can support even the most elaborate structures they\u2019ve devised.<\/p>\n<p>A combination of stainless steel wire rope, micro-cables and brass ferrules, gripple rope grips and superclamps can be used to hold up (or hold in place) structures, allowing them to be suspended high in the air. To find out more, check out our blogs on the latest sculpture to be supported by us or take a look at our relationship with <a href=\"\/wire-applications\/art-sculpture\/\">Barbara Franc and Thomas Heatherwick<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building work <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Successful wiring is vital to the effective placement of many components of a great building, like the implementation of lighting, the building of certain mechanisms for windows and much more.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies approach us needing the best wiring options for incredibly intricate projects. To give them a pointer, we\u2019ve developed a series of white papers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ormiston-wire.co.uk\/news\/wire-for-lighting\/\" target=\"_blank\">this one for lighting<\/a>, all of which detail how our wiring can be implemented without spoiling the aesthetics of your new building.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Special projects<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Everything we\u2019re asked to do is special, but some requests are more leftfield than others. Our back catalogue is brimming with special requests, one of which was the development of a replica of tripwire used during the Cold War. The aim \u2013 to teach operatives how to disarm potential antipersonnel devices.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, creating a facsimile of <a href=\"\/case-studies\/trip-wire\/\">Cold War tripwire<\/a> was key in terms of look, durability and texture.<\/p>\n<p>These special projects test our mettle but we\u2019ve always risen to the challenge.
