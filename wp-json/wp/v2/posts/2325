The device was described in the Wire Drawing Handbook like this:<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;A mill consisting of an iron plate is perforated with steel eyelets or holes of differing sizes. The ingot, or starting diameter wire as we know it today, is passed through the largest size hole and then one degree smaller and so is continued until it is drawn to the required size.&rsquo;<\/p>\n<p>While this was a necessarily primitive way of manufacturing wire, it was also incredibly effective and showed how the start of the British Industrial Revolution was significantly affecting the way everything was being produced around that time.<\/p>\n<p>James had jumped aboard a fast-moving point in industry, one that put Ormiston Wire in rude health within a very short period.<\/p>\n<p>It was a successful beginning, and the tradition of innovation by the Ormistons has carried on to the modern day.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>In the modern day<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Fast forward 200 years, through two centuries of successful business practices and profits, and meet Mark Ormiston, the current Managing Director of Ormiston Wire.<\/p>\n<p>Much like his predecessors, Mark has spent his tenure keeping the family business relevant and making sure that his employees are treated as fairly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The company has also diversified the uses for its wiring with some amazing projects.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, the <a href=\"\/case-studies\/thomas-heatherwicks-bleigiessen-sculptureheatherwick-bleigiessen\/\">Bleigessen<\/a>, a towering and beautiful sculpture, was unveiled to the public. And it wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without our strong and stable wiring.<\/p>\n<p>This extract from a back issue of our newsletter explains the process more thoroughly:<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;The 29-metre high installation is made up of 142,000 glass spheres suspended on 840 kilometres of stainless steel wires, to give the effect of a frozen waterfall.<\/p>\n<p>It took more than four months to string, hand and secure the wires, which are kept taut by nearly 27,000 springs. Ormiston has been supplying these wires &ndash; known as microcables &ndash; for more than 60 years.&rsquo;<\/p>\n<p>A huge job &ndash; and just one of many.<\/p>\n<p>In the past century, we&rsquo;ve had a hand in the production of the television series Thunderbirds, made the cars at McLaren safer, helped explorers traverse the Antarctic and even had our wiring implemented as part of a tourist attraction at Kew Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>What keeps bringing these people to our doors?<\/p>\n<p>In part, it&rsquo;s because of our excellent products, our rich heritage and our insistence on environmentally friendly practices.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Our green credentials<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been one step ahead of the eco-curve for many years. It&rsquo;s a commitment that&rsquo;s even brought Jonathan Bartley of the Green Party to our warehouse, and one we&rsquo;ve further committed to when we gained an<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ormiston-wire.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/ormiston-qa-2024-new.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"> internationally recognised environmental qualification.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;Our big question was this &ndash; how can we save money but maintain the quality of our products?<\/p>\n<p>So we thought of simple solutions to complicated questions. We switched off lights in offices that weren&rsquo;t being used, installed energy efficient lightbulbs, recycled our packaging and avoided landfill tax by purchasing a skip which is only emptied once every two years.<\/p>\n<p>Our sustainability efforts were increased in 2003, when we became the first UK-based SME to generate our own power with solar panels and a wind turbine.<\/p>\n<p>Reviewing the past 30 years, it&rsquo;s clear that we&rsquo;ve been at the forefront of sustainability, implementing a number of methods that other businesses are only just discovering.&rsquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Our pioneering approach to business has kept us in good stead for 225 years, and we have plenty more future plans to keep the ensuing two centuries just as exciting for our business.<\/p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s raise a glass to Ormiston Wire &ndash; a company that&rsquo;s as dedicated to family as it is to manufacturing excellent wiring for any occasion.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div><\/div><div class=\"x-col e2325-e15 m1sl-f m1sl-i\"><span class=\"x-image e2325-e16 m1sl-l\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.ormiston-wire.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Ormiston-Wire-Banner-768x384-1.png\" width=\"768\" height=\"384\" alt=\"Sample image\"><\/span><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"x-section e2325-e17 m1sl-0 m1sl-4 productDownloads\"><div class=\"x-row x-container max width e2325-e18 m1sl-5 m1sl-6 m1sl-9 m1sl-e\"><div class=\"x-row-inner\"><div class=\"x-col e2325-e19 m1sl-f m1sl-g\"><h2  class=\"h-custom-headline noTopMargin h2\" style=\"color: #193774;\"><span>Do you have an unusual application or usage for wire products?<\/span><\/h2><\/div><div class=\"x-col e2325-e21 m1sl-f m1sl-g\"><a class=\"x-anchor x-anchor-button has-graphic e2325-e22 m1sl-m\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"\/contact-us\/\"><div class=\"x-anchor-content\"><span class=\"x-graphic\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><i class=\"x-icon x-graphic-child x-graphic-icon x-graphic-primary\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-x-icon-s=\"&#xf095;\"><\/i><\/span><div class=\"x-anchor-text\"><span class=\"x-anchor-text-primary\"><strong>Contact us<\/strong> to discuss your project.<\/span><\/div><\/div><\/a><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Home225 Years Of Wiring Excellence \u2013 How We\u2019ve Stayed Successful For Two CenturiesHappy anniversary to us!
